AES File Encryption in Java

A simple and secure Java program that encrypts and decrypts files using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm.  
It ensures data confidentiality by converting files into unreadable ciphertext and restoring them with the correct encryption key.

Features

- Encrypt and decrypt any file using AES  
- Uses a secret key for secure data protection  
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data  
- Easy to run and modify for learning or personal use

How It Works

1. The program takes an input file and a password/key.  
2. It uses **AES** to encrypt the file into ciphertext.  
3. The encrypted file can later be decrypted using the same key.
